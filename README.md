```

cd My_kanban/
```

- and run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Turn on the demo (optional)

```bash
flask --app my_kanban init-db
```

This command will create a database file that contains a schema and some content that allows you to evaluate all the functions of the application.

In this example, 3 users are created:

| User      | Password |
|-----------|----------|
| demo_user | 0000     |
| user1     | 1111     |
| user2     | 2222     |

Use them to get a peek behind the scenes!

## Run

If you haven't skipped the demo step, create your own database file. Take the already existing code in the data folder as a basis.

Now everything is ready to run!

```bash
flask --app my_kanban run
```
